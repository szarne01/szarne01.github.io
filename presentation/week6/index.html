                        My website design for Larry's Car Leasing company is effective, and will ultimately provide Larry
                        with many customers. When I was considering the key elements a car leasing agency would require, the
                        first thing I thought of was, of course, sales. Larry will require sales in order to remain in business, and therefore,
                        my site incorperates many areas where drivers in need of leasing a vehicle can arrange a lease through the links on the website. This
                        offers good usability for costumers, and therefore Larry's business will be able to remain in business. This was the first aspect I considered
                        for the website, because I thought about the issues we outlined during your presentation regarding the author's website flaws. I ried to rectify these flaws on Larry's site.
                        <br />
                        Next, I also thought about what users will be looking for when they enter the site. users will surely want to, first and foremost, gain information about Larry's car selection,
                        analyze the leasing company's prices, and compare different vehicles available to be leased. As a result, my site further provides effective usability for drivers in need of leasing a vehicle
                        becuase I provide a link to all of that information right on the homepage. It's important to make your site clearly relay the information customers want to access, and therefore my site design for
                        Larry's website will gurantee the business' success. I also provide a link ont he homepage to the Contact Us section of the website which is another important area ont he site that customers will need to access
                        easily. I tried to keep usability and efficiency in mind when designing this website for Larry so that once customers enter the site, they stay until they have accessed all of the information they need, and ultimately
                        lease a car from Larry.
                        <br />
                        Finally, I tried to increase the site functionality by desiging a minimalist website that only features the crucial information customers need to know. As a result, Larry will make sales because of the site's excellent usability element.
