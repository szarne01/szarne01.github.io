  <h1>Collaborative Challenges:</h1>
  <h2>Medium Challenge</h2>
<ol>
   <li>
     You all spoke really well and I got the impression that you were well-prepared and knew your presentation
     information. I found it helpful that you gave an example of the conversation/feedback you wanted us to take
     part in during the first excercise (the verbal part of the assignment). By doing this, it gave me a better understading
     of what your expectations were for us during the verbal excercise.

     Evan's jokes were really funny, however in professional presentations (i.e. delivering presentations to companies, businesses, or bosses), it
     is best to remain serious and professional. As a result, my feedback to you, would be to refrain from making foolish jokes while giving a serious presentation to your classmates and professor.
   </li>
<br />
   <li>
     You did a really good job composing a clear rubric. I understood the marking scheme, and what you were
     looking for based on the rubric. I think it was a great idea to add colours on to the rubric to distinguish between
     the easy, medium, and hard challenges. The instructions and expectations were clearly delivered, and I was not confused during any stage of your presentation,
     which therefore made it more enoyable.

  <h2>Hard Challenge</h2>
  <ol>
     <li>
       Firstly, in order to make the website more aesthetically pleasing, I would start by centering the language options and
       log-in link within the bar on the top of the page. I would also The bar on the top of the page is also unecessary, and I would
       therefore eliminate it, and just keep the links on the red background. With the bar, the site looks cluttered. Less is more.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
      Currently, the navigation bar is below the header. I think that this is an appropriate location for it, however
      I would extend the pink bar, so that it takes up the entire page. As well, I would center the navigation links within the pink bar.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
       I think that the black background is too dark. I would remove it and just keep the background white.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
       It is important to establish a concrete colour scheme for a website. Otherwise, it will not look aesthetically pleasing.
       Therefore I would eliminate the pink bar at the top, the black background, the beige colour of the nav links, the turqiose and blue for the sign-up button, the blue in the header, and the yellow for the body font. I would instead,
       Make the website colours red, purple, white, and pink and use these throughout the website as the core colour scheme.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
        I think that it is difficult to read the darker shade of red in the header. I therefore would change all of the text in the header to white, in order to make it more legible, and to stay consistent with the site's colour scheme.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
        I would make the sign-up button red and white in order to stay consistent with the site's new colour scheme I established. I would also center the sign up text within the button, and make the button smaller to make it more aesthetically pleasing for website visitors.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
      I would make both sentences in the body purple. Once again, this is to stay consistent with the site's colour scheme, and so that both sentences match each other.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
      I thik the site would benefit from me centerig the image with the body content. Otherwise it looks as though it is not alligned.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
      I would make the navigation bar font red, in order to stay with the colour scheme, and make it more legible thent he current colour which is beige.
     </li>
<br />
     <li>
      To complete the site, I would put a pink footer at the bottom of the page. I would include a copyright for chicken mingle within the footer.I would also add a sign up button in the footer to enhance the site usability and guide visitors to where you want them to go.
     </li>
  </ol>
